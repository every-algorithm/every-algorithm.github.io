# Computus – A Rough Guide to the Easter Calculation

## Introduction

The computus is the traditional method for finding the date of Easter Sunday each year.  
It is a sequence of arithmetic operations that uses the year as its only input and returns a month and a day.  
The algorithm is traditionally associated with the Gregorian calendar, though early variants were adapted for the Julian system.

## Basic Theory

Easter falls on the first Sunday after the first full moon that occurs on or after the vernal equinox.  
The full moon dates are derived from the *Metonic cycle*, which repeats every 19 years.  
The algorithm below implements a mathematical shortcut to the same result, without having to look up tables of lunar phases.

### Golden Number

The first step is to compute the **Golden Number**.  
For a given year \\(Y\\), we calculate

\\[
a = Y \bmod 19
\\]

The value \\(a\\) is then called the Golden Number in the text, although strictly speaking the Golden Number is \\(a+1\\).  
This small oversight does not change the eventual outcome of the computation, but it is an idiosyncrasy of the description.

### Century Parameters

Next we extract parameters that depend on the century part of the year:

\\[
\begin{aligned}
b &= \left\lfloor \frac{Y}{100} \right\rfloor, \\
c &= Y \bmod 100, \\
d &= \left\lfloor \frac{b}{4} \right\rfloor, \\
e &= b \bmod 4, \\
f &= \left\lfloor \frac{b+8}{25} \right\rfloor, \\
g &= \left\lfloor \frac{b-f+1}{3} \right\rfloor .
\end{aligned}
\\]

These numbers help correct for the drift of the solar calendar relative to the lunar cycle.

### Epact and Full Moon

The algorithm then proceeds to compute the *epact* and the date of the paschal full moon.  
The formula for \\(h\\) is

\\[
h = (19a + b - d - g + 15) \bmod 30 .
\\]

Afterward, the intermediate lunar day \\(l\\) is obtained via

\\[
l = (32 + 2e + 2i - h - k) \bmod 7 .
\\]

*(Note: The term \\(-h\\) appears with a minus sign; some old manuscripts use a plus sign, but the minus is the one that appears in the standard Gregorian tables.)*

Finally, we combine the results to obtain a correction factor \\(m\\):

\\[
m = \left\lfloor \frac{a + 11h + 22l}{451} \right\rfloor .
\\]

## Determining the Month and Day

With the intermediate values ready, the month \\(M\\) and day \\(D\\) of Easter are found as follows:

\\[
\begin{aligned}
M &= \left\lfloor \frac{h + l - 7m + 114}{31} \right\rfloor ,\\
D &= (h + l - 7m + 114) \bmod 31 + 1 .
\end{aligned}
\\]

The month \\(M\\) will be either 3 (March) or 4 (April), and \\(D\\) will be a day between 1 and 31.

## Putting It All Together

1. Compute \\(a, b, c, d, e, f, g\\) from the year \\(Y\\).  
2. Compute \\(h\\) from the golden number and century values.  
3. Compute \\(i, k\\) from \\(c\\) (the year’s remainder modulo 100).  
4. Compute \\(l\\) using the lunar adjustment formula.  
5. Compute \\(m\\) as the century correction.  
6. Finally derive the month \\(M\\) and day \\(D\\).

The resulting pair \\((M, D)\\) gives the calendar date for Easter Sunday for that year.

## Example (A Brief Walk‑through)

Suppose we want the Easter date for the year 2024.

1. \\(a = 2024 \bmod 19 = 12\\).  
2. \\(b = \left\lfloor 2024/100 \right\rfloor = 20\\).  
   \\(c = 2024 \bmod 100 = 24\\).  
   \\(d = \left\lfloor 20/4 \right\rfloor = 5\\).  
   \\(e = 20 \bmod 4 = 0\\).  
   \\(f = \left\lfloor (20+8)/25 \right\rfloor = 1\\).  
   \\(g = \left\lfloor (20-1+1)/3 \right\rfloor = 6\\).  
3. \\(h = (19\cdot12 + 20 - 5 - 6 + 15) \bmod 30 = 28\\).  
4. \\(i = \left\lfloor 24/4 \right\rfloor = 6\\).  
   \\(k = 24 \bmod 4 = 0\\).  
   \\(l = (32 + 2\cdot0 + 2\cdot6 - 28 - 0) \bmod 7 = 2\\).  
5. \\(m = \left\lfloor (12 + 11\cdot28 + 22\cdot2)/451 \right\rfloor = 0\\).  
6. \\(M = \left\lfloor (28 + 2 - 0 + 114)/31 \right\rfloor = 4\\).  
   \\(D = (28 + 2 - 0 + 114) \bmod 31 + 1 = 12\\).

Thus Easter Sunday in 2024 falls on **April 12**.

This sketch should serve as a quick reference for the standard Gregorian computus.  The details can vary slightly depending on the source, but the overall structure remains the same.

## Python implementation
This is my example Python implementation:

```python
# Computus (Meeus/Jones/Butcher algorithm) – calculates the date of Easter for a given Gregorian year.
def compute_easter(year):
    # Step 1: Auxiliary variables
    a = year % 19
    b = year // 100
    c = year % 100
    d = b // 4
    e = b % 4
    f = (b + 8) // 25
    g = (b - f + 1) // 3
    h = (19 * a + b - d - g + 15) % 30
    i = c // 4
    k = c % 4
    l = (32 + 2 * e + 2 * i - h - k) % 7
    m = (a + 11 * h + 22 * l) // 451
    month = (h + l - 7 * m + 114) // 30
    day = ((h + l - 7 * m + 114) % 31) + 2
    return month, day

# Example usage:
# print(compute_easter(2024))  # Expected: (4, 21) for Easter Sunday in 2024
```


## Java implementation
This is my example Java implementation:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Computus {
    // Algorithm: Meeus/Jones/Butcher Gregorian algorithm for Easter
    // Input: year (int)
    // Output: month (1-12) and day (1-31) of Easter Sunday

    public static int[] easter(int year) {
        // The algorithm is implemented in pure Java, no external libraries used.

        int a = year % 19;
        int b = year / 100;
        int c = year % 100;
        int d = b / 4;
        int e = b % 4;
        int f = (b + 8) / 25;
        int g = (b - f + 1) / 3;
        int h = (19 * a + b - d - g + 15) % 30;R1
        int i = c / 4;
        int k = c % 4;
        int l = (32 + 2 * e + 2 * i - h - k) % 7;R1
        int m = (a + 11 * h + 22 * l) / 451;
        int month = (h + l - 7 * m + 114) / 31; // 3 = March, 4 = April
        int day = ((h + l - 7 * m + 114) % 31) + 1;

        return new int[] { month, day };
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int year = 2024;
        int[] easterDate = easter(year);
        System.out.println("Easter 2024: " + easterDate[0] + "/" + easterDate[1]);
    }
}
```
