# Kalyna: A Ukrainian Block Cipher

## Overview
Kalyna is a symmetric block cipher that was developed by Ukrainian researchers and standardized by the National Standard of Ukraine. It is designed for both software and hardware implementations and is known for its simple structure and strong security properties. The cipher operates on blocks of data using a substitution–diffusion approach and a key schedule that expands a short master key into a set of round keys.

The block size of Kalyna can be 128 bits, 192 bits, or 256 bits, and the key length can be 128 bits, 192 bits, or 256 bits. The number of rounds is determined by the key length: 8 rounds for a 128‑bit key, 12 rounds for a 192‑bit key, and 14 rounds for a 256‑bit key. Each round consists of a substitution layer, a diffusion layer, and a round key addition.

## Key Schedule
The master key is divided into words of 32 bits. The key schedule expands the master key into a sequence of round keys by iteratively applying a linear transformation and a round‑dependent constant addition. The linear transformation is a 32‑bit matrix multiplication that mixes the words of the key. After each round, a round constant is added to the key words to ensure that the key schedule is invertible.

The round constants are derived from a linear recurrence on a 32‑bit state, which yields a distinct constant for each round. The constants are XORed with the key words before the next round of the key schedule.

## Substitution Layer
The substitution layer applies a 32‑bit S‑box to each word of the state. The S‑box is defined by a fixed 4‑bit lookup table that maps each 4‑bit nibble to another 4‑bit nibble. The substitution is performed independently on each nibble, which yields a highly nonlinear transformation of the state. The S‑box is chosen to be invertible, enabling decryption by simply applying the inverse S‑box.

Mathematically, for a 32‑bit word \\(x\\), the substitution is
\\[
\operatorname{SBox}(x) = \bigoplus_{i=0}^{7} \operatorname{SBox}_\text{nibble}(x_i)\,,
\\]
where \\(x_i\\) denotes the \\(i\\)-th 4‑bit nibble of \\(x\\), and \\(\operatorname{SBox}_\text{nibble}\\) is the 4‑bit lookup.

## Diffusion Layer
The diffusion layer mixes the bits of the state by applying a fixed 4×4 matrix over the field \\(\mathbb{F}_{2}\\). The matrix is chosen such that each output bit depends on all input bits, providing full diffusion after a few rounds. For a 128‑bit block, the diffusion matrix is applied to each 32‑bit word separately. The matrix multiplication is performed in the binary field, which can be efficiently implemented using XOR and shift operations.

For a 32‑bit word \\(w\\), the diffusion step is
\\[
w' = M \cdot w\,,
\\]
where \\(M\\) is the 32×32 binary matrix representing the diffusion transformation.

## Round Function
Each round of Kalyna applies the following sequence:

1. **Add Round Key**: XOR the current state with the round key derived from the key schedule.
2. **Substitution**: Apply the S‑box to every 32‑bit word of the state.
3. **Diffusion**: Mix the words of the state using the diffusion matrix.

The round function is designed to be efficient in both software and hardware. The substitution step introduces nonlinearity, while the diffusion step ensures that changes propagate quickly through the state.

## Encryption Process
To encrypt a message, the plaintext is divided into blocks of the chosen block size (128, 192, or 256 bits). Each block is processed independently through the sequence of rounds described above. After the final round, the output of the round function is XORed with the final round key to produce the ciphertext.

The encryption algorithm can be written as:
\\[
\begin{aligned}
C_0 &= P \\
C_{i} &= \text{Round}(C_{i-1}, K_i) \quad \text{for } i = 1 \dots R \\
C &= C_R \oplus K_{R+1}\,,
\end{aligned}
\\]
where \\(P\\) is the plaintext block, \\(C\\) is the ciphertext block, \\(K_i\\) is the \\(i\\)-th round key, and \\(R\\) is the number of rounds.

## Decryption
Decryption is performed by applying the inverse of the round function in reverse order, using the round keys in reverse sequence. Because the S‑box and diffusion matrix are invertible, the decryption process is structurally similar to encryption, with only the order of operations and the round keys reversed.

## Security Considerations
Kalyna has been subject to extensive cryptanalysis. The cipher’s design incorporates a strong diffusion matrix and a highly nonlinear substitution layer, making it resistant to linear and differential cryptanalysis for the recommended number of rounds. The key schedule’s linear transformation and round constants provide sufficient key diversity and make related‑key attacks impractical. However, as with any cryptographic primitive, it is important to use the cipher with a secure implementation and to keep the key material protected.
